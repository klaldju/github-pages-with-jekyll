Quantum technology represents a new paradigm for the human civilization.

__"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"__ Arthur C. Clarke

## Why so spooky?
Simply because it doesn't make sense to us. Our minds are did not develop to grap certain things; for instance, imagine two particles without any apparent connection located on the opposite sides of the universe, and when one particle changes direction then the other instantly changes too - somehow they are linked. How? Why? Wth! Albert Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance", and it is just how the quantum world works.

## Fast and Curious
Quantum mecachanics has allowed us to experiment with the operating systems of nature to advance our computational capabilities.
In simple words, quantum-based computing could make devices such as cellphones and laptop computers millions of times faster.

## We are here
We live in the era of Classical Computing. The human experience has completely changed since the first computing devices were developed. However, just like basically everything in life, it has its pros and cons. As we create these positive changes some results are not predictable, so we are still learning to deal with technology as we prosper and find new challenges.
### The good
Our Classical computing allows us better scrutinize scientific discoveries - which has been crucial in these times of a global coronavirus pandemic. High-performing computers, combined with advanced software and programming, now enable machines to replace humans in routine and complex activities. Then we have self-directed cars and airplanes, we can diagnose diseases, optimize crop yields, numerically model processes and predict climate patters. We are exploring the vastness of space, building better and smarter cities, and even edit our genome to change their function through CRISPR. We improved manufacturing, materials, processing, created more immersive entertainment and learning experiences, and have more sustainable food and energy production.
### The bad
And this is on of our (many) challenges today: a social platform meant to connect people and build comminities turns into a weapon to spread bigottry and hate. That is what are dealing with. Then we have issues of privacy and technology ethics - including who owns our data. Plus the expansion of machines making the decisions on the roads, in hospitals, and even wars. 
Now imagine a person in the bathroom, hearing the call of nature and with a few minutes spare, decides to send a tweet on their smartphone. If it is an important but selfish person - like the deraged president of a country - this message sent will bounce all around the world at the speed of light, and it may influence markets, cause wars, and negativelly affect the life of millions of people. 
### The ugly
Mindlessness. Our future problems may make today's look easy. An entire generation of humans, the e-gen, already present differeces from previous generations, mainly concerning mental health and interpesonal relationships. Plus technology advances, so often does the social gap. How big can this gap get? What will the post-COVID19-gen be like? And the climate-crisis-gen? Will write in future updates.

## Where we will be
There is a limit, however, to our technology connundrum. And it refers to the physical limits of Classical computing capabilities. It is in this context of processing power that quantum computing emerges as the next step on human technological advancements. Quantum computing represents a new paradigm, as how far we will get depends on costs, how much of the quantum phenomena we can control, and how useful/meaningful are the results obtained at that point.
The scientific and commercial use of quantum computing have already begun. Now we can harness this new model of information processing to some real-life problems. Main stream offering is slowly emerging as quantum computing becomes more viable.  

## Human rEvolutions
At around 12,000 years ago humans are thouhgt to begin our Agricultural Revolution. We were farmers, living off the land, and were crafty, producing most of our good by hand. That is how we had always been until the Industrial Revolution started around 300 years ago. Our use of steam power transformed the age of mechanical production and transportation. Then 100 years later another revolution started when electricity was deployed at scale and mass production became a more viable option. Electricity also enabled the invention of telephone, starting an era of global telecommunication that still continues today. In the 1940's, less then 100 years ago, the third revolution started taking place with the invention of transistors, wich enabled the miniaturization of electrical switches. It was accelerated by the US space program, and the application in popular devices such as radio and later handheld calculators. Transistors are the essential building blocks of electronics and Classical computing. They work like switches, enabling or disabling the flow of electricity, wich translates into being on or off. The miniaturization of transistors allowed the production of microchips, which nowadays is are low cost mass production piece of equipment that paved the way for this third Industrial Revolution. An era of digitalization, instead of analog innovation. The chips convert analog information into language of computers - ones and zeros. Certain sequences of zeros and ones are convertioned to represent different letters and numbers. This third revolution was built on transistors made from silicon and still defines our lives today.
Now however a new trend emerges. The convergence of biological, physical and digital worlds are hinting to a fourth Industrial Revolution, combined with physical constraints and processing time issues related to Classical computing, it looks like quantum computing will play a central role in this new era of disruptive change for humanity.
## The Real Deal
A new way of framing and processing information - that is what quantum computing is about. The word "quantum" itself is the smallest discrete unit of a physical property.
### Classical Computing
Based on classical mechanics - electrons around an atom; electric currents (main ingredient of transistors) are created when electrons move between atoms; electrons move around a circuit and we can predict their location, speed and timing. Later in the 20th century this predictability was replaced by probability; processing at only one two states at any given time - a one or a zero, binary bits; 
### Quantum Computing
Based on quantum mechanics - describes through various means the interaction and motion of subatomic particles; questions certainty of a particle's behaviour and location at a given time; behavior subject to probability; leverages quantum bits, qubits, which are an induced property of a subatomic particle - can represent a one, zero, both and any value in between, all at the same time, a phenomenon called superposition;

## Back to some quantum spookiness
In the 20th century we also learned that light can behave like a particle or a wave - property known as wave-particle duality. Prior to the moment they realized and could make sense of what was happening, it was beieved that waves and particles were different and did not occupy the same physical domain. This theory was proven in the 1920s with an experiment demonstrating light waves colliding with particles. The double-slit experiment makes that point, also also shows that a quantu, state must be measured, and it collapses into a state og one or zero, something called a wave-function collapse. 


## Quantical or Clantum?
Classical and quantum mechanics are not in as much conflict as it may sound. Rigorous modelling and experiments show that our understanding of the quantum world is consistent with our observations of physics at a larger scale. Thus we can also imply that quantum computing ultimately explains classical computing. The subatomic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics enables classic mechanics, which manifests statistically accurate as we predict at the larger real-life scale.
Quantum mechanics has allowed to understand **what keeps electrons in orbit around an atom and how atoms bond to produce molecules**.
The answer to the question in the header: it is quantum stuff - let it be both options!
Because the final output from a qubit is a binary number, it can b eeasily fed into classical computing architecture

## Superposition and the quantum pond
If you drop a rock on opposite sides of a pond, the waves will ripple out and come together, forming superpositions. We then have crests and throughs that add and subtract from each other in a coherent manner that can be destructive or constructive. The qubits in quantum computing acts similarly by allowing us to manage a one, zero, or both all at the same time. **Superposition is the ability for a qubit to have multiple states simultaneously**. That is the nature, or the physics, of quantum mechanics that enables particles and waves to be in multiple states until a measurement is made - the point in which it collapeses into a zero or one. 

## Qubits
Quibts are created by changing the state of certain atoms and other particles the quantum realm.
